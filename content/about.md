Hi there, my name is Bemsibom, but most people call me Bemsi. I was
born and raised in Cameroon, but have lived in a few different places,
 including Nigeria, Ghana, the UAE, France, Belgium, and now the UK.

My academic background is in probability theory - I completed a PhD
in Mathematics at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, and then was a 
postdoctoral resesarch scientist at the University of Cambridge for a 
couple of years.

I made the switch to industry, and now work as a data scientist and 
engineer, and have worked with organisations. In the past few years, I 
have worked on projects across the data stack, involving financial data, 
geospatial data, and natural language.

In my free time, I like to read, write, lift weights and play the bass guitar.

To get in touch, email me: tbemsi "at" gmail "dot" com.
